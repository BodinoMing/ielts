**Governments should spend money on railways rather than roads.**

**To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?**

**Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.**

Some people believe that governments should invest more on railways rather than roads.While investing the railways is vital for societies , I believe that spending money on roads is also necessary in the modern age.

First, one argument in favor of railways concerns the convenience of people and environmental protection. To begin with,  railways have significant capacity advantages over roads, which  can carry a large volume of passengers and cargo efficiently and quickly.  For example, the high-speed railway system in China has facilitated the transport of goods and people across multiple cities and provinces and has alleviated pressure on road transport.Additionally, the carbon emissions produced by railways are generally lower than that of roads, making it a more environmentally friendly mode of transportation. 

Moreover, railways can also bring another benefit to job creation.  Building and maintaining the railways require specialized skills, and the construction of new railways can provide opportunities for employment, thus contributing to the growth of the local economy. In comparison, road maintenance jobs tend to be lower skilled and less specialized.

However, despite the advantages of railways, governments still need to maintain and improve road networks. Roads remain an essential part of most transportation systems and provide the primary mode of travel for many people. What's more, roads allow for greater flexibility, faster delivery,which can connect remote areas that may not be served by railways. 

In conclusion, while investing in railways is necessary, governments should invest in both railways and roads. A balanced approach can lead to a more integrated and sustainable transportation system, benefiting the economy and the environment.

**try our best to protect animals agree of disagree**

In modern society, protecting animals has never failed to attract people's attention. Some people hold the view that we should spare no effort to protect animals. Even though I think it is not easy to reach a clear conclusion, I still think it is of great relationality.

For one thing, protecting animals is an effective method to maintain the balance of ecosystem. Because the quality of ecosystem is positively related to the variety as well as amount of pieces. For instance, a recent research released by HKU showed the result that the increasing number of animal protecting areas played a significant role in environmental protection. More and More people choose to devote themselves to the field of animal protection. Therefore, it is necessary to protect animals. 

For another thing, what matters most in the development of medical technology is the resources of animal species, which requires a high level of animal protection. Because many of the results in the medical technology need the experiments of anomals. And it is the booming of medical science that ensure the quality of our lives. To be more specific, when solving the problems of Covid-19, many scientists tried to find  solutions by many animal experiments. Fortunately, they managed to create the vaccine of the pademic, which saved millions of human lives. Thus, protecting animals, protecting ourselves. 

In conclusion, I think we should try our best to protect the animals due to the reason that it is also a way to protect the environment as well as ourselves.
