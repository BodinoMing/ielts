## 2.3 examples

### 2.3.1 inventions

Describe an invention
You should say:
What the invention is
How you use this invention
Whether it is difficult to use it

 Honestly speaking, when it comes to an invention that I use on a regular basiss, I must admit, it's none other than.

 i choose this invention because  incredibly convenient and quick, in addition to that it has completely transformed the way we conduct financial transactions.

 to begin/start with, you need to have a smartphone and a mobile payment app such as Google Pay, Samsung Pay, or Apple Pay installed on your device. You can then link your bank account or credit/debit card to your mobile payment app.

 It also should be noted that when making a purchase in person at a retail store, you simply need to open the mobile payment app, select the card you want to use, and tap your phone on the contactless payment terminal. The payment is almost instant, and you do not need to swipe your card or enter a PIN. Making a mobile payment for an online purchase is similar. You select the mobile payment option during checkout, confirm the transaction on your phone, and the transaction is complete.

Overall, I think mobile payment is relatively easy to use, especially as mobile payment apps become more intuitive and widely adopted. It is also a more secure payment method compared to traditional payment methods as your sensitive information is securely stored within your mobile payment app.

in the future,In the long run, I believe that mobile payments will become the primary way that people conduct their transactions. From this moment on, I plan to continue using mobile payments whenever I can, and I would encourage others to do the same.

1. **Are there inventions that have changed the world? How?**

To tell you the truth, there have been many inventions that have had a profound impact on the world. I will give a few reasons to explain how they changed the world.

First and foremost,  Many inventions have greatly improved the quality of life for people all over the world.For example, the invention of medical technologies such as X-rays, antibiotics, or pacemakers have saved countless lives and improved the health of millions. In addition, other inventions such as electricity, running water, or the telephone have made people’s lives more comfortable and convenient.

 Another thing that comes to mind, Inventions have also been a driving force behind economic growth and progress. For instance, the printing press, industrial machinery, and the internet have all brought about significant changes in industries such as publishing, manufacturing, and communication. These changes have allowed countries to become more productive, create new jobs, and generate wealth.

**What are the qualities of a scientist?**

Frankly speaking scientists possess several important qualities that enable them to conduct research effectively.. ,In my opinion,the two most important are Passion for discovery and patience.

First and foremost, A scientist must enjoy the process of discovery and be motivated by the desire to learn more about the natural world. This passion drives scientists to ask questions, conduct research, and seek out new knowledge.

  It also should be noted that Scientific research often requires significant amounts of time and resources, and results may take months or even years to appear. Scientists must be patient and persistent in their work in order to gather the needed data and draw valid conclusions.

**Do all inventions bring benefits to our world?**

In my opinion, not all inventions bring benefits to our world, some inventions have also had negative consequences

first, plastic was invented to be a versatile and durable material that could be used in many different products and industries. However, plastic has also led to significant environmental problems, particularly in the form of plastic pollution in oceans and other ecosystems.

 Another thing that comes to mind  is cigarettes. While cigarettes were invented as a recreational product, they have caused significant harm to human health and have contributed to numerous health problems, including lung cancer, heart disease, and other chronic illnesses.

**Do you think people who have not been educated in school can invent things?**

 I definitely believe that people who have not been formally educated in school can invent things. While education can certainly be beneficial and provide individuals with valuable knowledge and skills, it is not a requirement for innovation

Firstly, many of the greatest inventors throughout history did not have formal education in their fields. Take, for example, the story of Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone. Bell was not an engineer or scientist. However, he was incredibly inventive and curious,,   which led to the invention of the telephone, which revolutionized communication around the world.

Secondly, a lack of formal education can sometimes even be an advantage for an inventor. Without the constraints of traditional thinking and conventional wisdom in a particular field, individuals may be able to think more creatively and outside of the box. 

**Who should support and sponsor inventors, governments or private companies?**

In my opinion, both governments and private companies have an important role to play in supporting and sponsoring inventors. The most effective approach will depend on the specific context of the invention and the goals of the innovation.

Firstly, government sponsorship can be particularly useful for projects with a clear public benefit or goal. For example, a government may fund research on a new vaccine or invest in renewable energy research. These types of inventions have a clear public benefit, which makes it appropriate for the government to support their development.

Secondly, private companies can be the primary source of innovation, particularly when it comes to commercial inventions with a profit motive. Private companies have the resources to invest in research and development, and they may also have the knowledge and expertise to bring a product to market successfully.

**What inventions do you think should be improved?**

As far as I'm concerned,There are plenty of inventions that could benefit from improvement in order to make them more efficient, sustainable, or environmentally friendly. Two examples of inventions that could be improved include traditional plastics and home appliances.

Plastics have brought a wealth of benefits to society, but their production and disposal also present significant environmental concerns related to pollution and waste. To address these concerns, research and development should focus on improving traditional plastics, exploring the plastics that can break down naturally in the environment.

Another thing that comes to mindis that Home appliances such as washing machines, refrigerators and air conditioners can be improved to be more energy efficient and sustainable. For instance, more efficient  air conditioner  systems can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other harmful substances generated by energy usage.

**What kinds of shops are popular in your city?**

As a matter of fact,there is a diverse range of shops catering to various interests and lifestyles. Some of the most popular types of shops in my city are large chain stores and outdoor gear stores.

Large chain stores, such as supermarkets and department stores, are popular in my city. These stores are known for their wide range of products at affordable prices, and they attract a large number of shoppers. Many of these stores can be found in centralized locations, making them convenient for those looking to purchase many things at once.

Outdoor gear stores also thrive in my city . These stores offer a wide range of outdoor-specific equipment, clothing, and footwear. The staff is often knowledgeable about the products and can offer advice on the best equipment for different activities and skill levels. These stores attract those who enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, and skiing.

**Why do young people enjoy going to some boutiques?**

As a matter of fact,, there are various reasons why 

One reason young people enjoy going to boutiques is that they receive personalized attention from staff. In boutique stores, don’t expect a rush or hustle environment, staff welcome and engage shoppers in a sincere way helping tailoring their shopping experience. This is a refreshing change from larger chain stores, where staff can be busy with other tasks or too focused on sales goals to provide attentive service. 

Additionally, boutiques often feature unique items that aren’t found in chain stores. Boutique owners often carefully select each item in their store, ensuring that everything is on trend and fashion-forward. This exclusive selection appeals to young shoppers looking for something that stands out and reflects their individual style.



**Do you think location is the key factor that attracts customers?**

A store’s product selection and quality have a significant impact on customer attraction and retention. Even if a store is in a convenient location, customers will not return if the products do not meet their needs.

with e-commerce and online shopping, location is becoming less important. Customers can purchase products from all over the world online, and in some cases, they can even have same-day delivery.
