**Do you think people who have not been educated in school can invent things?**

 I definitely believe that people who have not been formally educated in school can invent things. While education can certainly be beneficial and provide individuals with valuable knowledge and skills, it is not a requirement for innovation

Firstly, many of the greatest inventors throughout history did not have formal education in their fields. Take, for example, the story of Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone. Bell was not an engineer or scientist. However, he was incredibly inventive and curious,,   which led to the invention of the telephone, which revolutionized communication around the world.

Secondly, a lack of formal education can sometimes even be an advantage for an inventor. Without the constraints of traditional thinking and conventional wisdom in a particular field, individuals may be able to think more creatively and outside of the box. 

**Who should support and sponsor inventors, governments or private companies?**

In my opinion, both governments and private companies have an important role to play in supporting and sponsoring inventors. The most effective approach will depend on the specific context of the invention and the goals of the innovation.

Firstly, government sponsorship can be particularly useful for projects with a clear public benefit or goal. For example, a government may fund research on a new vaccine or invest in renewable energy research. These types of inventions have a clear public benefit, which makes it appropriate for the government to support their development.

Secondly, private companies can be the primary source of innovation, particularly when it comes to commercial inventions with a profit motive. Private companies have the resources to invest in research and development, and they may also have the knowledge and expertise to bring a product to market successfully.

**What inventions do you think should be improved?**

As far as I'm concerned,There are plenty of inventions that could benefit from improvement in order to make them more efficient, sustainable, or environmentally friendly. Two examples of inventions that could be improved include traditional plastics and home appliances.

Plastics have brought a wealth of benefits to society, but their production and disposal also present significant environmental concerns related to pollution and waste. To address these concerns, research and development should focus on improving traditional plastics, exploring the plastics that can break down naturally in the environment.

Another thing that comes to mindis that Home appliances such as washing machines, refrigerators and air conditioners can be improved to be more energy efficient and sustainable. For instance, more efficient  air conditioner  systems can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other harmful substances generated by energy usage.

Large chain stores, such as supermarkets and department stores, are popular in my city. These stores are known for their wide range of products at affordable prices, and they attract a large number of shoppers. Many of these stores can be found in centralized locations, making them convenient for those looking to purchase many things at once.

Outdoor gear stores also thrive in my city . These stores offer a wide range of outdoor-specific equipment, clothing, and footwear.

**Why do young people enjoy going to some boutiques?**

One reason young people enjoy going to boutiques is that they receive personalized attention from staff.

This is a refreshing change from larger chain stores, where staff can be busy with other tasks or too focused on sales goals to provide attentive service. 

Additionally, boutiques often feature unique items that aren’t found in chain stores. Boutique owners often carefully select each item in their store, ensuring that everything is on trend and fashion-forward. This exclusive selection appeals to young shoppers looking for something that stands out and reflects their individual style.



**Do you think location is the key factor that attracts customers?**

A store’s product selection and quality have a significant impact on customer attraction and retention. Even if a store is in a convenient location, customers will not return if the products do not meet their needs.

with e-commerce and online shopping, location is becoming less important. Customers can purchase products from all over the world online, and in some cases, they can even have same-day delivery.
