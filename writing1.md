举例：50.1% of the Yemen's population was in/among/belonged to the 0-14 year old group in the year 2000.

中文：（那存在）50.1%比例的也门人口是属于0-14岁组的。

举例：There was a proportion of 50.1% Yemen's population belonging/that belonged to 0-14 year old age group in the year 2000.

静态版：Figure A is the highest over time, at 50 in the year M and 100 in the year N.

动态版：Figure A experienced a steady growth, rising from 50 to 100.

**策略二：前+后**

**策略三：方式一+方式二**

The year N saw a rise to 30 in figure A, around 2 times higher than this figure in the year M/doubling this figure in the year M.

**策略四：主句+对比/类比**

The maps compare the development of a biomedical campus at present and in the future.

In the current plan, a main road running east-west divides the area and then turns north on the western side. To the north, there is a car parking lot located in the east while the rest of the area is covered with trees. In the southern part, a walkway runs through the center of the area. On the west side, there are a laboratory and a Biochemistry Apartment, and across the walkway, lie the Genetics Apartment, Biotech Apartment, and another laboratory.

In the upcoming campus development, the main road will be rerouted along the north and west boundaries of the area, while the walkway will remain in its current position. The existing car park is proposed to be reserved for students only, and a new car park constructed at the junction of the main roads is for staff. To the north, a Genetics-1 Apartment and a new Bio-imaging Building will be established. To the south, the Biochemistry and Biotech buildings is going to be expanded, and the current Genetics Building will be converted into a second structure for the same use.

Overall, not only changes to the the traffic routes and certain buildings will be made, some new establishments will also be built in the proposed plan.

**The graphs below give information about male and female prisoners in a European country between 1911 and 2001.**

**Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.**

The two line graphs show the male and female population from 1911 to 2011 of a prison in a European country.

It is noticeable that the number of male prisoners recorded an overall upward trend, while this number for females fluctuated over time.

Before the year of 1971, the population of male prisoners almost stayed the same in the first two decades, standing close to 20,000. However, it dropped suddenly to just 10,000 in 1931 and levelled off for another decade, but rebounded between 1951 and 1971. As for the population of female prisoners, it declined from more than 3,000 to less than 1,000 in the first six decades, despite an increase to over 1,000 in 1961.

After the year of 1971, the population of both genders in this prison registered a constant growth. The male prisoners more than doubled in number, rising from nearly 20,000 to almost 50,000. At the same time, the number of female prisoners simply increased by two times, from approcimately 900 to 1800.
